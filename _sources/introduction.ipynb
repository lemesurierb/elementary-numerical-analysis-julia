    "Julia: a New Alternative to Python and Matlab\n",
    "=============================================\n",
    "\n",
    "The two dominant dynamic programming language environments for numerical computing and graphics are\n",
    "- the open-source combination of Python with Numpy, Matplotlib, SciPy and other packages,\n",
    "as usef in this course,\n",
    "and\n",
    "- the older, commercial product Matlab(TM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Though I generally recommend the former, Matlab is long-established, espeiclain enginering fields, and arguably has a few advantages, like somewhat simpler notation for matrices and vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more recent innovation is the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/),\n",
    "which for one thing combines many of the virtues of both:\n",
    "- Like Python, it is open source with some nice modern programming language features (some newer and improving on Python),\n",
    "while also being\n",
    "- more compatability in its syntax and notation with existing Matlab code and standard linear angebra notation\n",
    "â€” By the way, Julia code usually runs faster that either Python or Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus I hav started developing a parallel version of this course and book that uses Julia in place of Python,\n",
    "and this section shows off a few drafts of sections of this conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "P.S. What does *Jupyter mean*?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"JuPyteR\" is a portmanteau of the names of the three most imortant modern open-source programming tools for scientific computing:\n",
    "- Julia,\n",
    "- Python,\n",
    "and\n",
    "- R (which is for statistical computing).\n",
    "\n",
    "So in particular, Jupyter notebooks and Jupyter books work fine with Julia, and even with a mix of these languages."
