    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of solving a system of $n$ simultaneous linear equations in $n$ unknowns,\n",
    "with matrix-vector form $A x = b$, is quite thoroughly understood as far as having a good general-purpose methods usable with any $n \\times n$ matrix $A$: essentially, Gaussian elimination (or row-reduction) as seen in most linear algebra courses, combined with some modifications to stay well away from division by zero: *partial pivoting*.\n",
    "Also, good robust software for this general case is readily available, for example in the Python packages NumPy and SciPy, or in Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, this basic algorithm can be very slow when $n$ is large – as it often is when dealing with differential equations (even more so with *partial* differential equations).\n",
    "We will see that it requires about $n^3/3$ arithmetic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus I will summarise the basic method of row reduction or Gaussian elimination, and then build on it with methods for doing things more robustly, and on methods for doing it faster in some important special cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When one has to solve many systems $A x^{(m)} = b^{(m)}$ with the same matrix $A$ but different right-hand side vectors $b^{(m)}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When $A$ is *banded*: most elements are zero, and all the non-zero elements $a_{i,j}$ are near the main diagonal: $|i - j|$ is far less than $n$. (*Aside on notation:* \"far less than\" is sometimes denoted $\\ll$, as in $|i-j| \\ll n$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When $A$ is *strictly diagonally dominant*: each diagonal element $a_{i,i}$ is larger in magnitude that the sum of the magnitudes of all other elements in the same row."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We might also explore some further topics, perhaps as individual projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When $A$ is *positive definite*: symmetric ($a_{i,j} = a_{j,i}$) and with all eigenvalues positive.\n",
    "This last condition would seem hard to verify, since computing all the eigenvalues of $A$ is harder that solving $Ax = b$,\n",
    "but there are important situations where this property is automatically guaranteed, such as with *Galerkin* and *finite-element methods* for solving boundary value problems for differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. When $A$ is *sparse*: most elements are zero, but not necessarily with all the non-zero elements near the main diagonal."

    "## Strategy for getting from mathematical facts to a good algorithm and then to its implentation in [Julia] code\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I take the opportunity to illustrate some useful strategies for getting from mathematical facts and ideas to good algorithms and working code for solving a numerical problem.\n",
    "The pattern we will see here, and often later, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1. Get a basic algorithm:\n",
    "1. Start with mathematical facts (like the equations $\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}x_j = b_i$).\n",
    "2. Solve to get an equation for each unknown — or for an updated aproximation of each unknown — in terms of other quantitities.\n",
    "3. Specify an order of evaluation in which all the quantities at right are evaluated earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this, it is often best to start with a verbal description before specifying the details in more precise and detailed mathematical form.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2. Refine to get a more **robust** algorithm:\n",
    "1. Identify cases that can lead to failure due to division by zero and such, and revise to avoid them.\n",
    "2. Avoid inaccuracy due to problems like severe rounding error. One rule of thumb is that anywhere that a zero value is a fatal flaw (in particular, division by zero), a very small value is also a hazard when rounding error is present.\n",
    "So **avoid very small denominators**. (We will soon examine this through the phenomenon of **loss of significance** and it extreme case **catastrophic cancellation**.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3. Refine to get a more **efficient** algorithm\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "- Avoid repeated evaluation of exactly the same quantity.\n",
    "- Avoid redundant calculations, such as ones whose value can be determnied in advance;\n",
    "for example, values that can be shown in advance to be zero.\n",
    "- Compare and choose between alternative algorithms."
